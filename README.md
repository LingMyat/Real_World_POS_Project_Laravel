## POS Project(laravel)

Here is my POS project. I named this project to PizzaHeaven.
It has two main sections. Admin panel and User panel.
I use jetstream for auth process.
In Admin panel admin can create categories and products.
And admin can delete user bad review and admin can recieve customer contact.
Admin need to prepare customer orders.Also admin can check order's detail.
 Also admin can give user account to admin assets.

In customer panel customer can update their profile.
And filter products by price. Add to cart . Checkout page.
View count with ajax. customer can review products. 
And also report about problem to admin panel.
